# Nomad WOD Apps

This directory is used for custom applications. 
You can safely remove this directory, 
if you do not plan to develop custom applications. 
Most of a Django project’s apps will be installed into the Python path and not 
be kept in your project root.

```txt
[projectname]/                  <- project root
